1. Docker Run command is used to run a container from an image
	 
2. For example, to run centos do the following,
	sudo docker run centos

	log: 
	[sudo] password for mariappan: 
	Unable to find image 'centos:latest' locally
	latest: Pulling from library/centos
	729ec3a6ada3: Pull complete 
	Digest: sha256:f94c1d992c193b3dc09e297ffd54d8a4f1dc946c37cbeceb26d35ce1647f88d9
	Status: Downloaded newer image for centos:latest

3. To run a docker container and stay within it (or in another words access the terminal of centos), do the following
	sudo docker run -it centos

	log:
	sudo docker run -it centos bash
	[root@a8a35da15bc0 /]# cat /etc/*release
	CentOS Linux release 8.0.1905 (Core) 
	NAME="CentOS Linux"
	VERSION="8 (Core)"
	ID="centos"
	ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"
	VERSION_ID="8"
	PLATFORM_ID="platform:el8"
	PRETTY_NAME="CentOS Linux 8 (Core)"
	ANSI_COLOR="0;31"

	We could see that, we are in the terminal of centos

4. To exit out of container, simply say 'exit'

5. To list all running docker containers
	sudo docker ps

6. To list all container (running as well as exited)
	sudo docker ps -a

7. To run a docker container in a 'detached' mode. So that we can go back to our terminal while docker-container is running in the background.
	sudo docker -d run centos

8. To stop a running docker container, just say 
	sudo docker stop '$CONTAINER-ID' or '$CONTAINER-NAME'

	note: container-id or container-name can be fetched from 'docker ps -a' command

9. To remove a docker container from the docker-host, do the following
	docker rm '$CONTAINER-ID'

	note: 
	1. we don't have to specify the complete container-id. Just starting few letters so that it's uniquely identified
	2. to remove multiple container, just specify multiple ids followed by space

	ex:
	mariappan@INLFM620Z2:~$ sudo docker rm a8 f4 30
	a8
	f4
	30

10. To list the images that are available in docker-host, do the following
	docker images

	ex:
	mariappan@INLFM620Z2:~$ sudo docker images
	REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
	centos              latest              0f3e07c0138f        4 weeks ago         220MB

11. To remove a docker image, do the follwoing. (Note: make sure to remove any container that is using the image that 	is about to be deleted)

	docker rmi 'image-name'

	ex:
	mariappan@INLFM620Z2:~$ sudo docker rmi centos
	Untagged: centos:latest
	Untagged: centos@sha256:f94c1d992c193b3dc09e297ffd54d8a4f1dc946c37cbeceb26d35ce1647f88d9
	Deleted: sha256:0f3e07c0138fbe05abcb7a9cc7d63d9bd4c980c3f61fea5efa32e7c4217ef4da
	Deleted: sha256:9e607bb861a7d58bece26dd2c02874beedd6a097c1b6eca5255d5eb0d2236983

12. To pull a docker image (not running it. just saving it locally)

	docker pull image-name
	eg: docker pull ubuntu

13. To run a command on a running container then 'exec' command can be helpful

	docker exec container-id command
	ex:
	mariappan@INLFM620Z2:~$ sudo docker exec 405f7fa3f617 cat /etc/*release
	NAME="CentOS Linux"
	VERSION="8 (Core)"
	ID="centos"
	ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"
	VERSION_ID="8"
	PLATFORM_ID="platform:el8"
	PRETTY_NAME="CentOS Linux 8 (Core)"
